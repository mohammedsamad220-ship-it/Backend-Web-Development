/**
 * Node.js Runtime Features — Streams, Buffers & the File System
 *
 * GOAL
 * Move the SAME file two different ways and feel the difference:
 *   1) Load the whole file into memory with fs.readFile, and log its size.
 *   2) Flow the file through a stream and pipe it to a writable stream (a copy).
 * Then explain, in your own words, why the stream approach is preferable for
 * large files.
 *
 * The starter already imports `fs` and `path` for you and points at a large
 * sample file (`sample-data.txt`) that lives next to this script.
 *
 * Run it with:  npm start
 */

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Absolute, OS-safe path to the sample file (do NOT hand-build paths with '+').
const INPUT = path.join(__dirname, 'sample-data.txt');
const OUTPUT = path.join(__dirname, 'sample-copy.txt');

// ── PART 1: read the whole file into memory, then log its size ──────────────
function readWholeFile() {
  fs.readFile(INPUT, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error("readFile error:", err.message);
      return;
    }

    console.log(
      `readFile: loaded ${data.length} bytes into memory at once`
    );
  });
}

// ── PART 2: stream the file and pipe it to a writable stream ────────────────
function streamFile() {
  const readStream = fs.createReadStream(INPUT);
  const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(OUTPUT);

  writeStream.on("finish", () => {
    console.log(
      "stream: finished copying via chunks (peak memory stays flat)"
    );

  readStream.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Read stream error:", err.message);
    writeStream.destroy();
  });

  writeStream.on("error", (err) => {
    console.error("Write stream error:", err.message);
  });

}

// ── PART 3: explain the difference ──────────────────────────────────────────
// TODO: In your OWN words, replace this comment with 2 to 3 sentences on WHY
//       the stream approach is preferable for large files. Mention memory:
//       readFile holds the whole file at once; the stream moves it in chunks
//       so peak memory stays flat regardless of file size.
//
// YOUR EXPLANATION:
//

// Run both approaches.
